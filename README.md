# Tic-Tac-Toe-unbeatable
An unbeatable python tic-tac-toe AI 

Not the most efficient code as it was created
with the challenge of not to use classes, dictionaries
and other things.

To play use the numpad keys with each key's position
coresponding to the same position on the board.
Else delete lines 26-38 to play with the number keys
with the first cell corresponding to 1 counting from the up-right to low-left
